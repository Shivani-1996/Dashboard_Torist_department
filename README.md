Purpose: To understand the tourism trends in Telangana, including which districts are popular with visitors, which are growing or declining in popularity, and what types of visitors are generating the most revenue. By identifying these trends and insights, helping the government and other stakeholders in the tourism industry make informed decisions about how to attract more visitors, increase revenue, and improve the overall tourism experience in Telangana.

**Data Preparation

Before creating this Power BI dashboard, I performed several operational steps to well prepare the data for analysis.Steps include:

* Data Collection: Collected data from ongoing challenge on codebasics website and then loaded and combined all files in Power BI
* Data Cleaning: Cleaned data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This involved correcting errors, and dealing with missing or null values.
* Data Transformation: Transformed the data to make it more suitable for analysis in Power BI. This involved merging multiple data sources, created conditional and custom columns and measures, and aggregating data.
* Data Visualization: Finally, created dashboard in Power BI . T

**Insights

* Overview of Districts that are doing well
We can see from top 10 ditricts by no. of visitors chart that both foreign and domestic visitors are mostly interested in visiting Hyderabad.Can do analysis what they like about the city and implement that thing in other city as well to increase revenue.

* Growing and declining Districts 
Overall Mancherial, Warangal(rural) and Bhadradri are growing over the years whereas major decline can be seen in Warangal(urban),nalgonda and karimnagar at least position.Are there any bad changes happened in karimnagar over the years that is not appreciated by visitors.
If we talk about specific foreign visitors they genrally don;t want to go to Jangaon and like Nagarkurnool the most.

* Observing peak and low months so that govermnent can plan something to do somthing interesting events during low months to attract tourists.
Foreign people generally like to vist telanagan or India mostly in winters whereas Indian people are comfortable round the year but ost comfortable in february

* Revenue generated from different visitor types.
If we see the trend, the interest of Indiam tourist has declined in visiting Telangana with CAGR -4.44%. Govt needs to find reason behind it whereas we can see that this places is attractinng more foreign tourists as CAGR is 24.74% for them.

* Observing districts where domestic visitors visit more compared to foreign and vice-versa. Govt can take lesson from what is mostly liked by domestic visitors and can implement those things ially like to vidit Telanaga or India mostly in winters so that they can feel confortable with weather, whereas domestic visitorn districts loved by foreign visitors because foeign visitors are bringing more revenue.
